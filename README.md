- Applied object-oriented principles to model pieces, boards, and game logic.
- Implemented a modular design for easier maintenance and future AI integration.
  
### [Virtual Memory Simulator (Java, JavaFX, OS Simulation)](https://github.com/larisa229/Virtual-Memory-Simulator.git) 
- Developed a complete virtual memory simulation system with a JavaFX GUI.
- Implemented core OS components including page tables, TLB, physical frames, and page fault handling.
- Built support for multiple page replacement policies: FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and Random.
- Created real-time visualization of memory state, frame usage, TLB contents, and per-process page tables.
- Added trace parsing, step-by-step execution, and automatic performance metrics (TLB hit rate, page fault rate, disk writes).
  
### [Warehouse Management System (Java, JavaFX, DAO)](https://github.com/larisa229/Warehouse-Management.git)
- Developed a complete warehouse/order management system with a JavaFX GUI.
- Implemented CRUD operations for clients, products, and orders using the DAO pattern.
- Integrated automatic bill generation and stock management.
- Used reflection for dynamic TableView creation and generic DAO operations.

### [Thread Management System (Java, JavaFX, Concurrency)](https://github.com/larisa229/Thread-Management.git)
- Developed a multi-threaded queue simulation system with multiple server threads.
- Implemented scheduling strategies: shortest queue and shortest waiting time.
- Built a JavaFX GUI with real-time vizualization of server queues, waiting cients, and statistics.
- Automated calculation of average waiting time, average service time, and peak hour.
- Included logging to both GUI and log files for tracking simulation events.

### [Task Management System (Java, Serialization)](https://github.com/larisa229/task-management)
- Built a task management application with persistent storage using Java serialization.
- Features include adding, updating, and deleting tasks, calculating work durations and providing employee statistics.
- Applied object-oriented principles for better modularity.
- Implemented file-based persistence to allow saving and loading tasks between sessions.

### [Hotel Booking System (PostgreSQL + Java)](https://github.com/larisa229/Hotel-Booking.git)
- Designed and implemented a complete hotel reservation database system.
- Used PostgreSQL for managing reservations, clients, and room availability.
- Integrated Java for backend operations including CRUD operations and data validation.

### [Tic Tac Toe Game (Python, Pygame)](https://github.com/larisa229/Tic-Tac-Toe.git)
- Developed a two-player game of Tic Tac Toe with a graphical interface using Pygame.
- Players alternate placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid board with mouse clicks.
- Wins and draws are detected automatically and signaled by highlighting the winning line in a different color.
- Demonstrates event handling, game loop mechanics and image rendering in Python.

### [Flappy Bird with Perceptron AI (Python, Pygame, Evolutionary Learning)](https://github.com/larisa229/Flappy-Bird-AI.git)
- Developed a complete Flappy Bird game with both manual and AI-controlled gameplay modes.
- Implemented a perceptron-based neural network to control autonomous agents in real time.
- Applied evolutionary learning techniques like fitness evaluation, mutation, cloning, and speciation.
- Built a full game loop with physics simulation, collision detection, animations, sound effects, and UI screens.
- Added persistent high score tracking for both human and AI gameplay modes.

### [MIPS Processor Implementation (VHDL)](https://github.com/larisa229/MIPS-VHDL-Processor.git)
- Designed and implemented a simplified MIPS-style processor in VHDL.
- Built the full datapath including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages.
- Implemented core components such as the control unit, ALU, register file, instruction memory, and data memory.
- Supported R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions with branch and jump control logic.

### [VHDL Locker Encryption System (VHDL)](https://github.com/larisa229/Locker-Encryption-VHDL.git)
- Designed a digital lock encryption system using VHDL.
- Created logic circuits for secure authentication and password validation.
- Simulated and tested functionality using Vivado to ensure reliable operation.
- Explored hardware description concepts and practical circuit design.
