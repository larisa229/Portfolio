# My Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of my personal and academic projects, showcasing my skills in object-oriented programming, database management, digital design.

## Featured Projects

### [Warehouse Management System (Java, JavaFX, DAO)](https://github.com/larisa229/Warehouse-Management.git)
- Developed a complete warehouse/order management system with a JavaFX GUI.
- Implemented CRUD operations for clients, products, and orders using the DAO pattern.
- Integrated automatic bill generation and stock management.
- Used reflection for dynamic TableView creation and generic DAO operations.

### [Thread Management System (Java, JavaFX, Concurrency)](https://github.com/larisa229/Thread-Management.git)
- Developed a multi-threaded queue simulation system with multiple server threads.
- Implemented scheduling strategies: shortest queue and shortest waiting time.
- Built a JavaFX GUI with real-time vizualization of server queues, waiting cients, and statistics.
- Automated calculation of average waiting time, average service time, and peak hour.
- Included logging to both GUI and log files for tracking simulation events.

### [Java Chess Engine](https://github.com/larisa229/chess-engine)
- Developed a two-player chess game with full move validation and check/checkmate/stalemate detection.
- Applied object-oriented principles to model pieces, boards, and game logic.
- Implemented a modular design for easier maintenance and future AI integration.

### [Task Management System (Java, Serialization)](https://github.com/larisa229/task-management)
- Built a task management application with persistent storage using Java serialization.
- Features include adding, updating, and deleting tasks, calculating work durations and providing employee statistics.
- Applied object-oriented principles for better modularity.
- Implemented file-based persistence to allow saving and loading tasks between sessions.

### [Hotel Booking System (PostgreSQL + Java)](https://github.com/larisa229/Hotel-Booking.git)
- Designed and implemented a complete hotel reservation database system.
- Used PostgreSQL for managing reservations, clients, and room availability.
- Integrated Java for backend operations including CRUD operations and data validation.

### [Tic Tac Toe Game (Python, Pygame)](https://github.com/larisa229/Tic-Tac-Toe.git)
